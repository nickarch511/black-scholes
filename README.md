# Black-Scholes Command-line program
This is a program that I wrote to make homework calculations much quicker for my Intro to the Mathematics of Finance course (MATH424). 
It will find the no-arbitrage cost of a call option of the given parameters as well as the number of shares required by delta-hedging to sell for every call option purchased.

The program is called as follows:
`python black-scholes.py s t k sigma r`
